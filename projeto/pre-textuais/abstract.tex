Robotic systems are part of human history. Whether in practical life, or in science fiction plays, for example, the work \emph{Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti}, created in 1920, where the term \textbf{"robot"} was first used, even before the first electronic computer was built.
Currently, robotics is used in the most varied sectors. It is used as a household cleaning aid in homes (for example, in the form of small vacuum-cleaning robots), are used as property security in some countries, aids in medical surgery and explores unknown worlds in space. Using robotics elements, this work intends to use the data captured by the motion sensors of a smartphone to create a wireless camera-operated motion control system that can be embedded in a robot to provide your operator a more intuitive interface. Design features, prototype assembly, camera control software programming, sensor data sending, motor drive and results are presented.\\

\textbf{Keywords}: Robotics, Kinematics, Control, Automation, Camera.
